	<h1>Who Is 'Bachelor' Star Victoria Fuller, Who's Been Embroiled In Drama?</h1>
	<h5>By Katherine J Igoe</h5>

	<p>Spoilers for The Bachelor. Peter Weber has already narrowed down his ladies—it feels like his season has gone by incredibly quickly, right??—and included in that number is contestant Victoria Fuller. We don't know a whole lot beyond what spoiler Instagram accounts, Reddit, and Reality Steve (a longtime show spoiler) have been able to dig up, but we already know she's one to watch, mostly because she was on a date with Weber on October 2 with singer Chase Rice that was heavily spoiled online—and it looked very dramatic. So what do we know so far?</p>

	<h3>She's from Virginia.</h3>
	<p>Fuller is 25 and from Virginia Beach. It's not...totally clear what her profession is? According to her LinkedIn, she was a recruiter at TEKsystems (although the company says she hasn't worked there in over a year), and is also a substitute teacher within the Virginia Beach public school system. Her Instagram says she's a medical sales rep, but it's unclear where or whether she's currently employed full-time. She graduated from Old Dominion University in 2015 with a degree in economics.</p>

	<h3>She's getting flack online for some of her modeling choices.</h3>
	<p>All right, so let's break this one down, because it's quite complex. Fuller has done some modeling as an influencer before the show. Recently, eagle-eyed fans pointed out that one of the brands she modeled appeared to have products that promoted a White Lives Matter message.</p>
	<p>However. Twitter comments underneath the post point out that the "white" lives in question actually pertain to marlins, not people—and that the brand had "Blue Lives Matter" apparel for blue marlins, too? If you look carefully at the quasi-Confederate flag shirt, it's got little marlins on it instead of stars. WLM Apparel used to have a website (marlinlivesmatter.com) and an Etsy—both of which no longer work. They still have a Facebook, which they haven't posted on since 2018, and an Instagram that hasn't been active since August 2019. The company's based in Virginia Beach and in the "About" section of Facebook it explains, "WLM Supports Marlin Conservation. That's Our Companies Passion."</p>
	<p>So, if I understand this correctly, it appears as though the company may have been utilizing messaging that (in another context) refers to people, to instead focus on a different message that pertains to animals. Given the inactivity of their sites, though, they may no longer sell anything (I wonder if the anger that's currently being directed at Fuller may have been directed at them too at some point). I can imagine how that might be complex for Fuller, who has not commented about the modeling gig.</p>

	<h3>Her on-show energy has been really vulnerable.</h3>
	<p>Given what we know about Fuller (more below—there has been some tough gossip about her dating history) it was quite a surprise to see that Fuller comes off as shy, nervous, and even sad at times. She was worried and scared about walking the catwalk during the fashion show date, and she was crushed that she didn't win. She came off as very endearing, at least IMO. And Weber felt the same way, giving her privacy when she cried to him about having a tough time and reassuring her that he has real feelings for her. He's also, on several indications, told her and others he thinks she's absolutely stunning.</p>
	<p>As a matter of fact, fans have also been indicating their early love for Fuller, and their surprise at all the hate directed her way. Now, of course, it's very early in the season (even Luke Parker didn't seem that bad early on) and there are a few high-stress moments coming up for Fuller (more below). This early behavior might be an act, or it might be genuine. But you should absolutely keep an eye on her either way.</p>

	<h3>She's done well on the show.</h3>
	<p>Fuller was one of the top four women that Weber's selected—no spoilers on the winner here, but it hasn't been confirmed what Weber's final selection was yet anyways. From what we know of leaked information and fan videos, Fuller made enemies of a number of women (she apparently screamed at at least one of them, apparently) but still got a one-on-one date to spend with Peter. As a matter of fact, that's exactly what led to a very dramatic, cringey situation during filming. The date was public (at Cedar Point Amusement Park in Ohio), so a whole bunch of it got spoiled.</p>

	<h3>Her date was...awkward.</h3>
	<p>Let's break it down. The two were at a Chase Rice concert, and lo and behold, it turns out that Fuller had dated or been involved with Rice:</p>
	<p>"I get emailed a lot of things about contestants. Before the show ever started filming, I was emailed quite a few things about Victoria. One thing in the laundry list that was sent me was that she definitely had spent time with/hung out/dated Chase Rice pre-show"</p>
	<p>So, in a nutshell, imagine you're dating this really cute guy, and the two of you are headed on a whirlwind date. Then who should the producers pick as the musical act for your date but your ex-boyfriend? Fuller apparently looked so mad, and then unfortunately she and Weber both had to talk to Rice in front of the cameras</p>
	<p>There is a 0 percent chance that situation wasn't intentional on the producers' part. TBD on whether she ends up getting the final rose after all this craziness, but we know this situation wasn't enough to get her sent home at the time.</p>

	<h3>Apparently she actually gets eliminated—then comes back. </h3>
	<p>At 1:58 of this preview video is right at the moment Fuller is called out during family dates for breaking up marriages and being a bad person (I'm assuming that's the gist). She pushes the camera away, walks away weeping, and says she's so done.</p>
	<p>Weber doesn't actually get to meet her family, but (spoilers!) Fuller comes back, convinces him to keep her on, and makes it through to overnights. That is some expert work on her part—again, no shade, I would love it if all this "Jed 2.0" stuff was wrong about her—so TBD on what that means about her getting the final rose. If not, I could definitely see a future for her on Bachelor in Paradise, so long as fans continue to love her.</p>

	<h3>There has been a ton of off-show drama with her.</h3>
	<p>Local sources have been busy speaking to Reality Steve about Fuller and her rumored pre-show dating behavior. Obviously, these are all just one-sided takes on a situation, but Reality Steve says he's "never" heard so many negative rumors (important: just rumors!) about one contestant. Ever. Oh God.</p>
	<p>Then, just a couple days ago, Fuller got into an altercation with the woman who spoke to Weber about some of these rumors, who may have even warned him off getting together with her at the end of his season. The two had a run-in at a bar, and...chaos ensued.</p>
	<p>For her part, Fuller has denied that any of the rumors are true and that she'll defend herself when she's able to (she probably can't speak out publicly until parts of her season air).TBH, this sort of feels like a Jed situation (except with Weber potentially having more intel earlier in his season, as opposed to Hannah), but I'm extremely bummed out about the whole thing. Here's hoping it doesn't play out in the same way.</p>
